## MVP User Flow
Sam is 10 years old, is in class, and finished his assignment. He is now surfing the web for fun free games to play. He clicks on a link to a free to play game called worms. When the webpage loads he sees a user guide at the bottom with a description and controlls. He reads in the description that the objective of the game is to get your worm as big as possible without hiting your own body or the walls. He then clicks on the start game button in the middle of the screen. He uses the arrow keys to guide his worm to the apple. When his worm eats the apple, the worm grows larger. He also sees his score and highscore on the top right of the screen go up whenever he eats an apple. After a while his worm was so huge that he hit his own body. A game over popup appered on the middle of the screen with his score and highscore, as well as a play again button. After playing a few more times to beat his high score class ended. He closed the browser and told his friends about an awesome free game they can play in their next class.
